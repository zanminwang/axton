//! Bounded loading of a Scope's historical interval, and the record
//! resolution both pull modes share.
//!
//! A bootstrap request walks `(after, until]` of one channel with the same
//! cursor-ordered `scan` and the same grouped Loader reads the ordinary delta
//! pull uses, in the caller's transaction. The upper bound is the
//! subscription's origin S, fixed for the whole walk, so the walk terminates
//! under sustained publication: a record republished above S leaves the
//! historical interval and belongs to that subscription's own delivery
//! ([Server / Engine / Pull](../../../docs/engineering/architecture/server/engine/pull.md)).
