// One assembled scenario for persistent Scope subscriptions (#150): a new
// subscription's origin is the first head the server acknowledges, and that
// origin is established once per subscription identity. Real Node client, native
// Rust engine, HTTP and WebSocket against the round-trip backend on PostgreSQL.
//
// What is published before the origin stays on the server until #151's explicit
// bootstrap() loads it; everything published after it arrives, across a
// disconnect and across closing and reopening the local database.
