//! The native runtime actor: one [`ClientRuntime`] and its SQLite connection
//! per open client, on a thread of its own, reached through a mailbox and an
//! outbox ([#134](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/134)).
//!
//! A carrier sees four calls. [`open`] registers the runtime and starts its
//! thread; [`submit`] admits one envelope into the mailbox (admission, never
//! completion); the actor publishes events into the outbox and calls the
//! carrier's [`WakeSink`] when the outbox turns non-empty; [`drain`] takes
//! what is there. [`detach`] ends the carrier's side for good.
//!
//! The process-wide registry lock covers only map lookups and insertions: it
//! is never held during database work, while waiting for a callback, or while
//! a wake sink runs, so independent clients never wait on one another.
//!
//! Wakes are edge-triggered with a drain/recheck handshake. The first publish
//! into an empty-or-drained outbox wakes; later publishes coalesce into the
//! same wake until a drain resets it, so a publish racing a drain either lands
//! in that drain or wakes again, and nothing is lost. The sink runs outside
//! the events lock but under the sink lock, which [`detach`] takes to clear
//! it: once `detach` returns, no invocation is in flight and none follows, so
//! the carrier can free what the sink points at.
//!
//! A carrier that can be torn down without detaching - a Node env ended by
//! `worker.terminate()` - records what it opened in [`Owners`] and detaches it
//! from its teardown hook, so a lost carrier never leaves the actor and its
//! SQLite transaction alive. [`wait_closed`] waits for an actor to release its
//! store.
