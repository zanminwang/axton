# Pull

## 1. Introduction and Goals

Pull applies what the server says about records. A page covers every channel the client follows; each change in it is the full state of one record with a *stamp*. Pull keeps two orders straight at once: each channel's cursor moves only by whole pages, and content for a record applies in stamp order no matter which path delivered it. A change that cannot be applied fails alone and is reported, never silently skipped.

## 3. Context and Scope

Pages come from two paths and go through one gate:

| Path | Entry | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP catch-up or WebSocket frame, via the live session | `receive_downlink(page, request?)` | `DownlinkProgress {disposition: covered/recover/applied, gaps, continues, report}` |
| Direct callers (tests, simulation) | `apply_page(page)` | `ApplyReport {applied, stale, cursors, reports}` |

`downlink_request()` builds the one request for every initialized subscription (`None` when none is). Pull owns the ledger: `axton_subscription` (channel → subscription identity, starting cursor, cursor; both cursors null until a first delivery boundary is committed, so a subscription without one asks for nothing) and `axton_record` (the stamp last applied per record, retained across deletion and unsubscription). It writes records through the authority applier shared with [Settlement](settlement.md); the only queue state it touches is the *diverged* mark on a mutation whose replay failed.

## 5. Building Block View

- **Channel gate, per channel.** A channel the client does not follow is ignored (a pull still in flight when the user unsubscribed cannot re-subscribe); a channel whose range ends at or before the local cursor is covered; a channel whose range starts beyond the local cursor is a gap. A gap on any channel means the page is not applied at all: `receive_downlink` reports `recover` and names the channels, `apply_page` returns an error.
- **Subscription epoch.** The client counts, in memory, how many times each channel's subscription changed since open, and remembers the pull it issued with those epochs. A page answering a pull from an earlier epoch was built against a cursor the resubscribe reset; it is stale before the gap test.
- **Stamp comparison.** Per record: a newer stamp applies (beneath pending operations or into the visible row); an older one is ignored; an equal one with equal content rewrites nothing, and with different content is a *conflict* report. A newer deletion removes the row and keeps its stamp; declared descendants are deleted locally without rewriting their own stamps.
- **Reports** (`Report {kind, model, identity, stamp, code?, ordinal?}`): `readFailed` for a change the server could not read (`error` set; nothing written), `skipped` for a state this client's schema refuses (nothing written), `conflict` for equal-stamp different content (nothing written), `diverged` for a pending operation that no longer replays over the new base (the base is visible; the operation stays queued, is still sent and is marked `diverged` in `record_status` until it completes or is rejected).
- **No ownership.** A channel is a delivery path; unsubscribing deletes the subscription row only.

Code: `apply_page` in [client/downlink.rs](../../../../../crates/client/src/downlink.rs); the applier in [client/authority.rs](../../../../../crates/client/src/authority.rs); replay and divergence in [client/mutate.rs](../../../../../crates/client/src/mutate.rs) (`rebuild`); ledger statements in [client/ledger.rs](../../../../../crates/client/src/ledger.rs); `receive_downlink` and `downlink_request` in [client/transport.rs](../../../../../crates/client/src/transport.rs); `Report` and `ApplyReport` in [client/lib.rs](../../../../../crates/client/src/lib.rs).

## 6. Runtime View

A page is one SQLite transaction: gate every channel; apply every change by stamp, collecting reports; rebuild the records that hold a base once; move every gated-through channel's cursor to its `to`; commit. A crash before commit leaves the cursors where they were, and the re-pulled page applies idempotently by stamp. A page never completes a push; that is the receipt's job ([Settlement](settlement.md)). The reports go back to the caller; the live session hands them to the application ([Live session](../connection/controller/live-session.md)).

## 9. Architecture Decisions

**Channels deliver; they do not own ([#55](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/55), [#116](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/116)).** The earlier design kept a claim per `(channel, record)` and deleted a record when its last claim was released by an unsubscribe or a confirmed deletion. That made a subscription the owner of local data and forced a delete to wait for every channel's confirmation. Now unsubscribing stops delivery and resets the cursor, and nothing else; retained data is readable but not promised fresh without an update source, and cache eviction is a separate concern ([#61](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/61)). Stamp rows are retained for deleted records as the evidence that keeps stale content from resurrecting them; reclaiming them is [#61](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/61) too.

**One applier for every path.** A page change and a receipt record are the same authority, and the same function stages them ([Settlement §9](settlement.md#9-architecture-decisions)).

**A page is one unit ([#95](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/95)).** Changes carry no cursor, so a cursor can only move to a page's end; applying the whole page in one transaction makes that exact, and the stamp makes a re-pull harmless. The earlier per-change transactions existed only because each change had its own cursor.

**Nothing is silent ([#51](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/51), [#122](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/122)).** Skipping a change the client cannot use keeps one bad record from blocking a channel, but the application is told. A divergence shows the authoritative base rather than guessing a merge; the queued operation still reaches the server, whose handler decides.

## 10. Quality Requirements

- **A page moves every channel it names and a shared record lands once; channels are gated one by one and a gap holds the whole page; stale pages from an earlier subscription are dropped; cursors and stamps are independent** (guarantee A2, D3). Evidence: [sqlite/tests/downlink.rs](../../../../../crates/sqlite/tests/downlink.rs) `a_page_moves_every_channel_it_names_and_a_shared_record_lands_once`, `channels_are_gated_one_by_one_and_a_gap_holds_the_whole_page`, `page_from_a_previous_subscription_is_stale_not_a_gap`, `older_subscription_response_cannot_discard_a_fresh_response`, `cursor_and_stamp_are_independent`; [crates/sim/tests/authority.rs](../../../../../crates/sim/tests/authority.rs) `a2_pages_apply_only_in_cursor_order`.
- **An error change keeps local content and stamp and is reported; a change the schema refuses is reported and the cursor still advances; a conflict is reported through `receive_downlink`** (guarantees D7, D8). Evidence: `an_error_change_keeps_local_content_and_stamp_and_is_reported`, `a_change_the_schema_refuses_is_reported_and_the_cursor_still_advances`, `a_conflict_is_reported_through_receive_downlink`, `equal_stamp_is_idempotent_or_a_diagnostic`; [crates/sim/tests/reports.rs](../../../../../crates/sim/tests/reports.rs) `a_loader_failure_isolates_one_record`, `a_loader_refusal_carries_its_code`, `a_malformed_change_is_skipped_and_reported`.
- **A pending edit that no longer replays is reported as diverged, stays queued and is still sent; completion clears the mark; a receipt can diverge too** (guarantee D8). Evidence: [sqlite/tests/settlement.rs](../../../../../crates/sqlite/tests/settlement.rs) `a_pending_update_over_a_deleted_base_diverges_and_is_still_sent`, `a_pending_create_over_an_existing_base_diverges`, `divergence_is_reported_from_a_receipt_too`; `a_divergence_is_reported_and_cleared_by_completion`.
- **Content changes only by record stamp; deletes keep their stamp evidence and cascade without rewriting descendants' stamps** (guarantees D2, D5). Evidence: `older_stamp_cannot_regress_newer_authority_but_advances_the_cursor`, `newer_authority_lands_beneath_pending_edits_and_replays_them`, `cross_channel_delete_applies_by_stamp_and_retains_the_stamp`, `delete_cascades_to_descendants_and_keeps_their_stamps`; [crates/sim/tests/distribution.rs](../../../../../crates/sim/tests/distribution.rs).
- **Unsubscribing retains rows, stamps, before images and pending edits** (guarantee D6). Evidence: `unsubscribing_retains_records_and_later_pages_are_dropped`, `another_channel_updates_retained_content_and_restart_keeps_it`.
- **Random runs: an unapplied change never moves a stamp or rewrites content, and a page moves a channel to its end or not at all.** Evidence: [sim.rs](../../../../../crates/sim/src/sim.rs) delivery checks under [crates/sim/tests/invariants.rs](../../../../../crates/sim/tests/invariants.rs).

## 11. Risks and Technical Debt

**Accepted limitation.** The subscription epoch and the issued-pull memory live in the process. A page for a pull that was not issued through the client is judged by the cursor gate alone.

**Accepted limitation.** A record whose change was skipped or could not be read stays as it was until it is delivered again (a later publication, or an explicit fetch, [#116](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/116)); nothing retries it on its own.

**Accepted limitation.** Stamp rows are never reclaimed and retained content is never evicted ([#61](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/61)). Applying a large page holds one write transaction for its duration; the threading model that keeps that off the host thread is [#134](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/134).
