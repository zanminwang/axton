# Common

## 1. Introduction and Goals

Three runtimes exchange the same messages: Rust, TypeScript and Dart. The protocol therefore fixes one byte-exact JSON encoding, one numeric range and one identity encoding, so that a request frozen on a client can be re-sent byte for byte, a receipt can be cached against it, and a record has the same key everywhere.

## 2. Architecture Constraints

Wire names are short and stable: `channels` and `cursors` name channels and their positions, `stamp` is a record's version. Every counter (cursor, stamp, batch sequence, ordinal, version) is an integer in `0..=2^53−1` so JavaScript reads it exactly.

## 5. Building Block View

**Canonical JSON.** Object keys are sorted by UTF-16 code units, which is JavaScript's sort order, arrays stay in place, and scalars follow RFC 8785, so `-0` and `1.0` encode as `0` and `1`. Request bytes, receipt caching and identity keys all use it.

**Counters.** Any finite integral number spelling (`1e0`, `0.0`, `-0`) within range is accepted; some positions additionally forbid zero.

**Identity.** A record key is the model name plus the normalized identity object; its canonical JSON is the `identityKey` the server stores and the key the client ledgers use ([Models](../schema/models.md)).

**State shapes.** A received state must contain every non-identity field (nullable ones default to `null`), may not contain identity fields, and drops unknown fields, which is what lets an older client accept states from a newer server. Loader output on the server is looser: it may include identity fields and omit nullable ones. A patch names only known non-identity fields and keeps explicit `null`.

**Errors.** Core has one error kind carrying a message. The server runtime has a structured error `{code, message, details?}` whose codes the HTTP layer maps to statuses ([SDKs / Bindings](../sdks/bindings.md), [Server / Connection / Transport](../server/connection/transport.md)).

**Shared fixtures.** [fixtures/protocol/counter-boundaries.json](../../../../fixtures/protocol/counter-boundaries.json) lists the pull counter boundary cases both sides must agree on; [fixtures/protocol/pull-page.json](../../../../fixtures/protocol/pull-page.json) the page cases ([Pull](pull.md)); [fixtures/protocol/receipt-authority.json](../../../../fixtures/protocol/receipt-authority.json) the receipt cases ([Push](push.md)).

Code: [core/lib.rs](../../../../crates/core/src/lib.rs) (`canonical_json`), [core/protocol.rs](../../../../crates/core/src/protocol.rs) (`counter`, `read_counter`, `limits`), [core/schema.rs](../../../../crates/core/src/schema.rs) (`RecordKey`, state and patch validation).

## 8. Crosscutting Concepts

Three limits are shared by both sides but not negotiated on the wire: 20 mutations and 256 KiB per push, 50 changes per channel in a pull page. They are defined once, in `limits` of [core/protocol.rs](../../../../crates/core/src/protocol.rs), and every consumer reads them from there: the push request decoder and the client's [batching](../client/engine/push/batching.md), the per-channel continuation rule (`CursorRange::continues`) and the [server pull](../server/engine/pull.md) scan. A page with more than 50 changes per named channel is refused by `PullPage::validate`. Making the limits configurable is [#11](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/11).

Host resource limits are not protocol rules and stay with each transport: 1 MiB HTTP bodies and WebSocket frames on the server, 8 MiB WebSocket frames and the page buffers on the clients ([Client transport](../client/connection/transport.md), [Server transport](../server/connection/transport.md)).

[fixtures/protocol/live-messages.json](../../../../fixtures/protocol/live-messages.json) records the limit values and the subscription message cases ([Subscriptions](subscriptions.md)).

## 10. Quality Requirements

- **Encoding is byte-identical to JavaScript's: key order, number spelling and unknown-field preservation**. Evidence: [core/tests/contracts.rs](../../../../crates/core/tests/contracts.rs) `canonical_numbers_match_javascript_and_utf16_key_order`, `a_page_names_its_channels_and_keeps_unknown_fields_out_of_the_records`, `server_pull_request_accepts_js_integer_number_spellings`, `shared_wire_fixtures_preserve_counter_boundaries`.
- **A received state tolerates extra fields and refuses missing required ones**. Evidence: `received_state_supports_additive_schema_evolution`, `state_is_complete_but_patch_preserves_absent_and_null`.

Executed 2026-09-16: `cargo test -p axton-core --locked` passed with the tests above.

## 11. Risks and Technical Debt

**Accepted limitation.** Client-direction errors cross the bindings as message text; nothing branches on that wording. Owned by [SDKs / Bindings](../sdks/bindings.md).
