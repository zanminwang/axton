# Bootstrap ledger containment and barrier settlement (#163)

## Context and failure

Bootstrap stores a historical run beside its subscription in `axton_subscription`. An active-row scan currently decodes every row with `collect::<Result<Vec<_>>>()` in `bootstrap_task_rows`. One malformed active row therefore makes both `bootstrap_schedule` and `bootstrap_barriers` fail, so unrelated healthy runs cannot be scheduled or settled. A named `bootstrap_state` read should still fail for that malformed registration: it must not invent a state.

`settleable_scopes` builds one `IN` list from its input. Duplicate channel names waste parameters and a sufficiently large input exceeds SQLite's supported variable count. The candidate query currently selects only channel names, then `settle_barrier` decodes each selected row inside one write transaction. A malformed candidate can abort settlement of healthy candidates.

This is a client ledger and Downlink worker bugfix. It changes no protocol, storage schema, subscription identity, bootstrap phase, or public method signature. The active issue uses “Scope” in older code; new prose uses Channel per #152, without renaming identifiers in this fix.

## Required behavior

1. A malformed active Bootstrap row is retained exactly as stored. It is neither reset nor marked failed or complete. The scheduler skips that row and continues fair rotation among healthy requested/loading runs. Reopen scans and barrier settlement likewise continue for healthy channels.
2. The application receives a diagnostic naming the affected channel and saying that its stored Bootstrap row cannot be decoded. A repeated pump observing the same malformed row does not send the diagnostic again. A changed malformed row can be reported again; a repaired or removed row clears the suppression state. A fresh worker may report it once on reopen. Diagnostics contain no record payload.
3. A direct read of the malformed registration (`bootstrap_state`, `request_bootstrap`, or a named page operation) keeps returning a decode error. Existing `bootstrap_tasks` remains a `Result<Vec<BootstrapState>>` and retains error visibility to direct Rust callers. Internal scheduling and barrier scans use a tolerant result carrying healthy rows plus row diagnostics.
4. Settlement treats the input as a set of channel names, queries it in chunks of at most 900 bind values, and returns each eligible channel once in stable channel order. An empty input does no SQL work. The 900 limit is below SQLite's older 999-variable floor, with no other bind values in the statement. Each candidate's full ledger row is decoded before its name enters the write batch, so an undecodable candidate is reported and skipped while healthy candidates settle. The existing transaction rechecks each healthy candidate against committed state.
5. Only a row decode error is contained. SQL prepare/query errors, store errors, and write errors still fail the operation. SQLite values that cannot cross `ClientStore::rows` (for example BLOB or invalid UTF-8) fail at the storage boundary before row-by-row decoding; they are a material limit of this bounded fix.
6. A healthy run still completes only after its interval is processed and delivery reaches the fixed barrier. A bad row never supplies completion evidence. Ordinary downlink delivery and other Bootstrap pages continue, and no spin or repeated diagnostic loop is introduced.

## Design

Introduce a small internal scan result in `bootstrap_ledger.rs`: healthy decoded rows and per-row diagnostics. Keep `decode` strict. The tolerant helper iterates the rows returned by SQL and handles `decode` failure for one row at a time. It extracts the channel from the first selected value, which is the table's primary key; if that key is not text, there is no safe channel to isolate and the scan fails. The diagnostic includes that key and a bounded decode-error description. No column is rewritten and no new persistent error table is added.

`bootstrap_schedule` and `bootstrap_barriers` consume the tolerant scan through internal methods that return both their normal result and diagnostics. Existing public signatures stay intact. The worker's `schedule` and `resume` paths send the diagnostics through a new internal Downlink action handled by the existing JavaScript and Dart connection `onError` callbacks. The worker remembers a channel-to-row-fingerprint map for diagnostics it has already emitted. Refresh that map from every complete active-row scan, removing channels that disappeared or decoded successfully. For candidate-only settlement scans, update entries for observed malformed candidates but do not clear entries for channels outside the candidate set. The fingerprint is derived from the raw selected values so a changed bad row is observable without emitting the stored values. A repeated dirty wake thus cannot flood callbacks; when no healthy task exists, scheduling still clears `loading.dirty` and waits for a normal wake.

The barrier candidate query first sorts and deduplicates its input, then splits it into chunks of 900. For each chunk, select the full ledger columns under the existing phase/barrier/cursor predicate. Decode candidates one at a time and accumulate healthy channel names plus diagnostics. The shared read transaction closes before a write opens. Sort and deduplicate the healthy names once more, then keep the existing one-write transaction and `settle_barrier` recheck. A corrupt row skipped from that list never enters the transaction. On startup, the active-row scan used by `bootstrap_barriers` also isolates bad rows, so reopening can settle healthy reached barriers.

The Downlink action is an internal bridge message, not a new application API. It carries channel and a concise diagnostic string, and JS/Dart turn it into an Error/StateError for their existing `onError` hooks. It is distinct from a record `Report` (which requires model, identity, and stamp) and from a `Bootstrap` status transition (which must correspond to a committed state change). The worker may produce this action alongside healthy requests or settlement actions in one pump.

## Alternatives considered

- Mark the bad run `failed`: rejected because a row that cannot be decoded cannot be safely rewritten with its original run, progress, and barrier preserved.
- Swallow the decode error and return only healthy rows: rejected because the application would have no account of the stuck registration.
- Add a persistent quarantine ledger: unnecessary for this issue; the bad row already remains in place and an in-memory reporting fingerprint bounds duplicate diagnostics within a worker lifetime.
- Increase SQLite's bind limit or use one unbounded query: leaves behavior dependent on SQLite build options. Fixed chunks work across supported limits.

## Verification design

SQLite ledger tests should corrupt one active row directly, then assert that healthy tasks remain available, the malformed bytes remain unchanged, named access still errors, healthy barrier settlement succeeds, and duplicate plus more-than-999 input names settle exactly once. Worker tests should exercise a bad row beside a healthy loading run and a healthy reached barrier, assert exactly one diagnostic per unchanged row across pumps, assert recovery after repair/removal, and assert no zero-delay loop. JS and Dart connection tests should check the new internal diagnostic action reaches `onError` without changing Bootstrap status. Run focused Rust tests, JS/Dart binding tests where the bridge changed, formatting/linting, and the repository gate described in `docs/engineering/testing/running.md` when implementation is complete.

## Spec self-review

The scope is one client ledger and its diagnostic bridge. No migration, protocol change, or terminology rename is required. The corrupt row remains durable and visible; healthy scheduling and settlement remain independent. The specified 900-value chunks and deduplication make the SQL bound explicit. The limitation at the storage JSON boundary is called out rather than silently promised away. Implementation and tests are pending; this document records the target design, not shipped behavior.
