# Transport

## 1. Introduction and Goals

The transport moves bytes. It knows the three HTTP routes and the WebSocket route, adds the bearer token, honors cancellation, and buffers streamed frames within a bound. It never looks inside a request body or a frame, not even to tell the acknowledgement from a page; those come from and go to Rust.

## 3. Context and Scope

Configuration is `{url, token}`, where `token` is a string or a function returning one. Push, catch-up and direct Action calls use `POST <url>/sync/mutations`, `POST <url>/sync/pull` and `POST <url>/sync/actions`; the stream is a WebSocket on `<url>/sync/live`. All four carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. A non-2xx response becomes an error carrying `status` (TypeScript) or `AuthenticationExpired` for 401 and `HttpException` otherwise (Dart), which is what [scheduling](controller/scheduling.md) uses to trigger an auth refresh. Direct calls use the connection's configured carrier independently of the durable push and live lanes. `directTimeoutMs` in TypeScript accepts an integer from 1 to 2,147,483,647 milliseconds; `directTimeout` in Dart accepts a positive `Duration`. Both bound the entire direct attempt, including token acquisition and refresh, and default to 30 seconds. A timeout or lost response leaves execution unknown. Authentication retry reuses the prepared request body and call ID.

## 5. Building Block View

Both transports do the same things with language-native tools:

| Concern | TypeScript | Dart |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP | `fetch` with an `AbortSignal` | one `HttpClient` per request, force-closed on cancel |
| WebSocket | `ws` with an 8 MiB frame limit | `dart:io` with an 8 MiB text check |
| Frame buffer | 64 frames; the socket is paused while a frame is delivered | 128 frames or 8 MiB in total |
| Overflow | buffer cleared, the frame that arrived is kept, `overflow` reported to the worker | same |
| Oversized frame | `ws` closes the socket (code 1009) | the frame is refused and the socket ends |
| Cancellation | abort signal terminates the socket, even mid-upgrade | a future completes and closes the socket |

The buffer only bounds delivery: frames are handed to the [Downlink worker](controller/downlink-worker.md) one at a time, in order, and handing one over only queues it. On `overflow` the worker recovers every channel from the durable cursor; overflowing never restarts an in-flight HTTP request, so a burst of pages cannot starve the catch-up that advances the durable cursor. The worker's own bound on pages it holds is the same in both languages. An oversized frame is not a protocol violation the worker judges: either transport ends the socket and reports `closed`, and the worker reconnects with backoff like any other dropped socket.

Code: [client-js/transport.mts](../../../../../packages/client-js/transport.mts), [client-js/live.mts](../../../../../packages/client-js/live.mts), [dart/live.dart](../../../../../packages/dart/lib/src/live.dart).

## 10. Quality Requirements

- **The socket sends the subscribe frame and delivers frames in order without interpreting them; cancellation ends a stalled token, an in-flight request and an opening handshake without reporting a close, and a token that resolves late cannot start a request.** Evidence: [live.test.mjs](../../../../../integration/bindings/client-js/live.test.mjs) `internal socket sends the subscribe frame, delivers frames in order, and cancellation ends the socket`, `live transport cancellation does not wait for a stalled token`, `close cancels opening handshake…`, `client close abandons a stalled live token…`; [live_test.dart](../../../../../packages/dart/test/live_test.dart) `the socket sends the subscribe frame and delivers frames in order`, `cancel push before token resolution prevents any later HTTP request`, `HTTP catch-up cancellation ends stalled token and in-flight response`.
- **Overflow preserves in-flight HTTP progress and converges on the latest head.** Evidence: `bounded receive overflow preserves in-flight HTTP progress and recovers the latest head`; [live_test.dart](../../../../../packages/dart/test/live_test.dart) `bounded receive buffer (128 pages) overflows into recovery without restarting the in-flight HTTP catch-up` for the page bound and `bounded receive buffer (8 MiB) overflows on ten large pages without restarting the in-flight HTTP catch-up` for the byte bound.

## 11. Risks and Technical Debt

**Accepted limitation.** The TypeScript transport is Node-only: it depends on the `ws` package and sets an upgrade header browsers cannot set. Browser and WebAssembly support is planned ([#59](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/59)).
