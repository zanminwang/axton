# Reconciliation

## 1. Introduction and Goals

Schema artifacts preserve the original Mutation input contract and exact frozen request. Canonical read materialization is separate: a compatible descriptor reorder keeps queued input, while a changed read contract stages a desired context. Enabling it drains frozen Batches, clears rows with Stream evidence and Bootstraps again ([rollover](../../protocols/sync.md#materialization-rollover)); Model DDL alone proves no coverage. Format-4 files are refused intact rather than rebuilt or wiped automatically.

## 5. Building Block View

[Implementation](../../../../../crates/client/src/store05.rs) owns this component. [Protocol 5](../../protocols/sync.md) owns shared context, delivery and settlement rules.


### The table contract

Each public Model table uses its Model name and field columns. Engine tables use the `axton_` prefix and are not application query surfaces. Ordinary application reads see the replayed projection.
