# API reference

Use this index to find the interface you call or implement. Local Model examples use `Entry`; the [To-do example](getting-started.md) uses the `Todo` model and `AddTodo` / `SetTodoDone` Mutations. Generated names follow your schema.

| `client.queries.<name>(args, { once, refresh })`, `client.queries.invalidate.<name>` | Reuse, refresh or discard the saved complete result of a direct Query | [Reuse a Query result](frontend/client-api.md#reuse-a-query-result-with-once) |
| `CallOutcome`, `CallError`, `CallOptions`, Dart `CallSuccess` / `CallFailure` / `CallStore` | Read a durable outcome, handle failures and choose which Model outputs are stored | [Storing Model results](frontend/client-api.md#storing-model-results) |
| `client.scopes`, `Subscription` | Subscribe to a named channel and follow that registration's status | [Channels](frontend/client-api.md#channels) |
| `subscription.bootstrap()`, `status.bootstrap` | Load what the channel held before this subscription started, and follow that load | [Channels](frontend/client-api.md#channels) |
| `client.channels` | The retained spelling: subscribe or unsubscribe by channel name | [Channels](frontend/client-api.md#channels) |
| `client.connection` | Pause, resume or wake background sync | [Connections](frontend/runtime.md#connection-controls) |
| `client.syncState`, `client.close` | Inspect pending work and release resources | [Status and lifecycle](frontend/client-api.md#status-and-lifecycle) |
| Model, Identity, Patch, Filter and Order types | Pass typed data to generated methods | [Generated data types](frontend/client-api.md#generated-data-types) |
| `Mutations<Tx>`, `Queries<Tx>`, `MutationContext<Tx>`, `QueryContext<Tx>` | Implement each operation's authoritative business logic | [Handlers](backend/api.md#handlers) |
| `Loaders<Tx>`, `LoaderCall` | Return current records for synchronization | [Loaders](backend/api.md#loaders) |
| `changes`, `Changes` | Report a record a handler changed beyond the uploaded operations, so it is stamped, read back and returned in the receipt | [Handlers](backend/api.md#handlers) |
| `publish`, `PublishArgs`, Model reference functions | Distribute a Mutation's changed records, or chosen records, to a channel | [Publishing](backend/api.md#publishing) |
| `createBackend`, `Options<Tx>` | Connect your implementations to the backend runtime | [Backend setup](backend/api.md#createbackend), [What your backend owns](backend/api.md#what-your-backend-owns) |
| `backend.listen` | Serve sync requests and close the listener | [Listener](backend/api.md#listener), [Deploy the backend](backend/deployment.md) |
| `Authenticate`, `devAuth` | Identify the caller | [Authentication](backend/api.md#authentication) |
| `CallRejected`, `translateRejection`, `onError`, `EngineError` | Reject business operations and diagnose failures | [Errors](backend/api.md#errors) |
| `backend.transaction`, `TransactionCall` | Write outside a handler with the same `changes` and `publish`; subscribers wake after commit | [Background writes](backend/api.md#background-writes) |
| `pg`, `prisma`, `drizzle`, `PostgresDriver`, `persistence` | Run business and sync storage in one PostgreSQL transaction through your own access tool | [Database](backend/database.md) |

## Advanced interfaces

| Interface | Use it to | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React Native `databasePath` | Resolve a persistent local database path | [React Native setup](frontend/platforms.md#react-native) |
| `Client`, `Transaction`, `QuerySpec`, `RecordValue` | Access the generic runtime beneath generated APIs | [Client runtime](frontend/runtime.md) |
| `ServerOptions`, `SyncServer`, `ConnectionOptions` | Configure the backend connection and refresh credentials | [Server connection](frontend/runtime.md#server-connection) |
| `RuntimeConnection`, `AuthenticationExpired` | Control Dart sync and identify authentication failures | [Connections](frontend/runtime.md#connection-controls) |
| `syncState`, `models.<name>.syncState`, `dismissRejection`, `drop` | Inspect a record's pending work and handle rejected or unsent calls | [Recovery APIs](frontend/runtime.md#pending-work-and-recovery) |
| `pendingTasks`, `runPrerequisites`, `setReadiness` | Complete prerequisite I/O before a durable call can be sent | [Prerequisites](frontend/runtime.md#prerequisites) |
| `freeze`, `acknowledge`, `applyPull` | Exercise the engine protocol in tests and tooling | [Protocol primitives](frontend/runtime.md#protocol-primitives) |
| `ReadPort`, `WritePort`, `LivePort`, model factories and codecs | Bind generated facades to a compatible runtime | [Generated extension points](frontend/client-api.md#extension-points) |
| `loaderHooks`, `Native` | Prepare a loader call or supply the native backend binding | [Backend extension points](backend/api.md#extension-points) |
| Compiler command and `.model` declarations | Generate and evolve the interface contract | [Schema compiler](schema/reference.md) |

The generated application API is the normal entry point. Raw backend protocol methods marked `@internal` in the implementation are not a supported application integration surface; use `listen`, handlers, loaders and transaction-bound notifications.
