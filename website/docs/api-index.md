# API reference

Use this index to find the interface you call or implement. Local Model examples use `Entry`; the [To-do example](getting-started.md) uses the `Todo` model and `AddTodo` / `SetTodoDone` Mutations. Generated names follow your schema.

| `Loaders<Tx>`, `LoaderCall` | Return current records for synchronization | [Loaders](backend/api.md#loaders) |
| `invalidate`, `RecordDeclaration` | Declare a record a handler changed beyond its Model inputs, so holding Streams receive current authority (not a business result) | [Streams](backend/api.md#streams) |
| `ctx.stream`, `ctx.streams(names)`, `Stream`, `BootstrapStream`, `RecordDeclaration`, `RecordRef`, Model reference functions | Track records durably and request selected authority invalidation | [Streams](backend/api.md#streams) |
| `createBackend`, `Options<Tx>` | Connect your implementations to the backend runtime | [Backend setup](backend/api.md#createbackend), [What your backend owns](backend/api.md#what-your-backend-owns) |

| `CallRejected`, `translateRejection`, `onError`, `EngineError` | Reject business operations and diagnose failures | [Errors](backend/api.md#errors) |
| `backend.transaction`, `TransactionCall` | Write outside a handler with the same `invalidate` and `stream`; subscribers wake after commit | [Background writes](backend/api.md#background-writes) |
| `backend.publish` | Settle the same `invalidate` and `stream` inside a transaction your code already owns; call the returned wake after it commits | [In a transaction you own](backend/api.md#in-a-transaction-you-own) |
| `pg`, `prisma`, `drizzle`, `PostgresDriver`, `persistence` | Run business and sync storage in one PostgreSQL transaction through your own access tool | [Database](backend/database.md) |

## Advanced interfaces

| Interface | Use it to | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React Native `databasePath` | Resolve a persistent local database path | [React Native setup](frontend/platforms.md#react-native) |
| `Client`, `Transaction`, `QuerySpec`, `RecordValue` | Access the generic runtime beneath generated APIs | [Client runtime](frontend/runtime.md) |
| `ServerOptions`, `SyncServer`, `ConnectionOptions` | Configure the backend connection, its headers, and refresh credentials | [Server connection](frontend/runtime.md#server-connection) |
| `AdmissionRefused` | Recognize a backend's admission refusal in `onError`; the connection has stopped | [Server connection](frontend/runtime.md#server-connection) |
| `Transport`, `HttpRoute` (TypeScript) | Type the HTTP carrier a platform host build supplies (not passed to `open`/`connect`): current effects use `handshake`, `push`, `pull`, `action` and `fetch` | [Server connection](frontend/runtime.md#server-connection) |
| `RuntimeConnection`, `AuthenticationExpired` | Control Dart sync and identify authentication failures | [Connections](frontend/runtime.md#connection-controls) |
| `syncState`, `models.<name>.syncState`, `dismissRejection`, `drop` | Inspect a record's pending work and handle rejected or unsent calls | [Recovery APIs](frontend/runtime.md#pending-work-and-recovery) |
| `rejections` (`watch`, `get`, `dismiss`), `failures` (`watch`, `retry`, `drop`), `outbound.watchPending`, `RefusedAct`, `FailedAct`, `FailedTask`, `SubmittedAct`, `ActOperation` | Watch and resolve refused calls, calls stuck on a failed prerequisite and the pending count, account-wide | [Unsent work](frontend/runtime.md#unsent-work) |
| `tx.rejections.dismiss`, `tx.failures.retry`, `tx.failures.drop` | Resolve unsent work inside a transaction, atomically with a replacement call | [Repair inside a transaction](frontend/runtime.md#repair-inside-a-transaction) |
| `open({ prerequisites })`, `PrerequisiteRetry`, `pendingTasks`, `setReadiness` | Complete prerequisite I/O before a durable call can be sent | [Prerequisites](frontend/runtime.md#prerequisites) |
| `ReadPort`, `LivePort`, `FetchPort`, `FetchOptions`, model factories and codecs | Bind generated facades to a compatible runtime | [Generated extension points](frontend/client-api.md#extension-points) |
| `loaderHooks`, `Native` | Prepare a loader call or supply the native backend binding | [Backend extension points](backend/api.md#extension-points) |
| Compiler command and `.model` declarations | Generate and evolve the interface contract | [Schema compiler](schema/reference.md) |

The generated application API is the normal entry point. Raw backend protocol methods marked `@internal` in the implementation are not a supported application integration surface; use `listen`, handlers, loaders and transaction-bound notifications.
