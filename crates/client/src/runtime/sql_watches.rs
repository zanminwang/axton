//! Watched read-only SQL over several Models
//! ([#184](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/184)).
//!
//! `watchSql {sql, parameters}` asks the store which tables the statement
//! reads - SQLite's answer, found while it prepares the statement, never the
//! application's - and refuses anything but one read-only `SELECT` (or
//! `WITH … SELECT`) that reads no engine table. It then runs the statement on
//! the committed reader, answers its observer id and publishes the rows after
//! the task's completion, as a `watch` does.
//!
//! The engine signals the watch through [`Client::watch`] after every commit
//! that wrote one of its tables, whatever the path: a local write, a
//! settlement or rejection rollback, an optimistic replay, a Stream page, a
//! Load page, a Fetch or a rebuild. At the end of a unit with no callback
//! transaction open, only a signalled watch re-runs, and it publishes only a
//! result that differs from the last one. A commit that writes none of its
//! tables does not re-run it. A re-run that fails is reported and the watch
//! stays; `unwatch` ends it with no snapshot, and close with a terminal one.
//! Both also remove its engine watcher. A statement that reads no table a
//! commit writes (`SELECT 1`, SQLite's own `sqlite_*` tables) registers
//! none: no commit signals it.
