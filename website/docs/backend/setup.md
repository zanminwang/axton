# TypeScript backend SDK

This TypeScript SDK embeds the shared Rust server runtime in your Node application. Business Handlers and Loaders are implemented in TypeScript, against the `Mutations`, `Queries` and `Loaders` interfaces the compiler generates from your `.model` file.

`index.mts` runs on Node with TypeScript support (Node 22.18+), or can be compiled with TypeScript. It loads the native engine from `@axtonjs/native`; in a source checkout, `npm ci` then `bash scripts/build.sh` builds that addon. Supply an injected `native` implementation to use another build of it.

Given a schema with `Todo`, a Mutation `AddTodo` and a Query `FindTodos`, the compiler emits `generated/backend.ts`, which binds the schema. Your application implements `Mutations<Tx>`, `Queries<Tx>` and `Loaders<Tx>`, with optional typed Bootstrap preparation:

```ts title="action-contract"
import { createBackend, devAuth } from './generated/backend.ts';
import { mutations, queries } from './handlers.ts';
import { loaders } from './loaders.ts';

const backend = createBackend<Tx>({
  database, // a shim such as prisma(db); Tx is its transaction type
  authenticate: devAuth(),
  mutations,
  queries,
  loaders,
  protocol5: { authorizeStream: (principal, stream, tx) => stream === `User:${principal}` },
});
const server = await backend.listen({ port: 4242 });
console.log(server.url);
```

The generated `createBackend` needs no `config` option: the schema is already bound. The runtime's own `createBackend` (`packages/backend/server/index.mts`) still takes `config` explicitly, for callers that build the schema themselves.

`mutations`, `queries` and `loaders` are application modules typed against the generated interfaces; a schema without Queries omits `queries`, one without Mutations omits `mutations`. The application enforces write and read permissions. Stream authorization, business permissions, unique constraints and child deletion are the application's responsibility ([What your backend owns](api.md#what-your-backend-owns)).

## Call objects

A Mutation or Query Handler receives `{ctx, args}`. `args` is typed from the retained input of that version; `ctx` supplies the application's `tx`, authenticated `userId` and stable `callId`, and its initiating `stream` plus explicit `streams([...])`. Mutation contexts also have `invalidate`; Query and optional Bootstrap preparation contexts are track-only. The Handler returns only the explicit outputs its operation declares, never an input under the same name; Model outputs are identities resolved by a Loader. A Query must not change business state; the framework refuses Query effects it can see but cannot inspect your SQL ([Handlers](api.md#handlers)). A Loader receives `{ids, tx, userId}` and returns one record or null per identity. It is never told a stream.

## Track and invalidate

`ctx.stream.track.todo(identityOrList)` or `ctx.streams(names).track.todo(identityOrList)` establishes persistent interest; repeat tracking is idempotent. `ctx.invalidate.todo(identityOrList)` advances authority and notifies every tracking Stream. `ctx.streams(names).invalidate.todo(identityOrList)` notifies only selected existing holders, for viewer-specific changes. Explicitly invalidate every business record changed, including deleted children whose Loader now answers `null`.

Tracking is independent of permission and survives absence. Shared content changes must reach all holders. See [Streams](api.md#streams) for mixed references, declaration lifetimes and authority rules.

## Authentication

`authenticate` is `(request) => userId | null | undefined`, called per HTTP/WebSocket request; returning `null` or `undefined` rejects the request. `devAuth()` is a development-only implementation that trusts the `Authorization: Bearer <userId>` header verbatim — never use it in production.

## Errors

`onError?: (error) => void` on `BackendOptions` is called for server-side failures that clients only see as `{ code: "server" }` over HTTP: `authenticate` throws, persistence faults, settlement errors, loader refusals while serving a page, and live drain failures. A failure raised by the native engine arrives as an `EngineError` with a stable `code` and a readable `message`; branch on the code, never on the message. See [Errors](api.md#errors) for the codes that map to HTTP statuses.

## Background jobs

Outside a Handler there is no readback and no receipt, so a change reaches clients only through Streams. Use `backend.transaction`; its body gets the same `invalidate` and `stream` as a Mutation Handler, the framework settles explicit tracking and existing-holder invalidation inside the same transaction as your writes, and wakes live subscribers after commit:

```ts
await backend.transaction(async ({ tx, streams, invalidate }) => {
  await tx.entry.update({ where: { id: 'entry-1' }, data: { text: 'From a job' } });
  invalidate.entry({ id: 'entry-1' });
  streams(['book:demo']).track.entry({ id: 'entry-1' });
});
```

See [background writes](api.md#background-writes).

## Transaction ownership

The outer transaction belongs to the application. Persistence, Handler, and Loader callbacks all receive that same transaction. The runner must provide serializable isolation, roll back on rejected promises, and retry serialization conflicts by running the whole body again. Every shim of [`@axtonjs/postgres`](database.md) supplies this contract.

## Call results

A successful Handler returns the explicit outputs declared by its Mutation or Query; an operation with no explicit outputs may return nothing. AXTON resolves Model outputs through the versioned Loader at that invocation. The invocation result can differ from later Stream authority. `CallRejected` or a registered `translateRejection` code rolls back that call's savepoint; ordinary Handler/Loader exceptions become `handler.failed` / `loader.failed` and reach `onError`. Retryable database errors retry the transaction, and persistence faults abort it. Durable calls expose final outcomes through `Call.wait()`; direct calls return a final result or throw `CallError`. See [handlers](api.md#handlers) and [client Mutations and Queries](../frontend/client-api.md#mutations-and-queries).

## Loaders and Stream delivery

Loaders return one record or null per supplied identity in order. Missing or unreadable content is null. Stream authority and bounded manifest commit units are materialized through these versioned viewer Loaders inside the same Serializable transaction. A failed read is not absence and cannot justify delivery or manifest progress. The runtime retains unit dependency evidence and fails oversized groups explicitly.

Optional Bootstrap preparation tracks initial records. The schema selects historical Model types with `@@bootstrap`; no Load declarations, continuation handler or public Load manager are required. Named Query and Fetch return invocation snapshots with request-level boolean `store`.

Run `integration/persistence/server/run.sh` for the disposable PostgreSQL/Prisma integration suite. Its database is created, used, and destroyed by the runner.

`backend.listen({ port, host? })` starts a Node HTTP+WebSocket server that serves Handshake `/sync/handshake`, Mutations `/sync/mutations`, Query `/sync/actions`, Fetch `/sync/fetch`, owned materialization `/sync/materialize`, finite delivery `/sync/pull`, and WebSocket `/sync/live` on one port, and returns `{ url, close() }`. It resolves once the listener is bound.

For every option, callback, return value and failure mode, see the [backend interface reference](api.md). For process placement, the reverse-proxy configuration and trust boundaries, see [Deploy the backend](deployment.md).
