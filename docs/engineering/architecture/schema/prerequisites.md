# Prerequisites

## 1. Introduction and Goals

Some mutations must not reach the server until the application has finished other work, such as uploading a file the record refers to. A prerequisite expresses that wait in the schema, so the client holds the mutation back while the optimistic write stays visible, and nothing about uploads leaks into the sync engine.

## 3. Context and Scope

```
prerequisite Uploaded(key String)
model Attachment {
  id  UUID
  key String @requires(Uploaded(key: self))
  @@id(id)
}
```

The descriptor carries `prerequisites: [{name, fields}]` and `requirements: [{model, field, name, arguments}]`. The client derives *tasks* from them when a mutation is enqueued. The application registers its handlers once, with the client's open option `prerequisites` keyed by prerequisite name, and the runtime runs them; the SDK also exposes `pendingTasks()` and `setReadiness(key, state)`. The server never sees prerequisites.

## 5. Building Block View

A declaration has a unique name and typed fields (`String`, `UUID`, `DateTime`, `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`). A requirement invokes one declaration, supplies every field, and today every argument must be `self`, meaning the value of the annotated field.

A **task key** is what ties them to the queue. When a wire operation carries a non-null value for an annotated field, the client forms the key `{"name": Uploaded, "arguments": {"key": <value>}}` in canonical JSON and stores it against the mutation. Two mutations that need the same upload share one key; marking it ready releases both. A mutation is not frozen while any of its keys is pending or failed ([Dependencies](../client/engine/push/dependencies.md)).

The runner is Rust's ([#185](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/185)). The open request names the prerequisites the application has handlers for; each must be declared by the requested schema, or the open fails with `invalid prerequisite handler <name>`. The client [runtime](../client/runtime.md) runs a handler whenever a task becomes pending - a commit that queued it, an open that finds it after a restart, a reset to `pending` - with no call from the host: it issues one `prerequisite` effect for the first pending task, in key order, whose `name` has a handler and that is not backing off, and no transaction is held while the handler runs. One handler runs at a time per client. A task whose prerequisite has no handler, or an opaque key with no `name`, is never run; the application settles it through `setReadiness`.

What the handler comes to decides the task:

| Handler | Task |
| --- | --- |
| Resolves | Resolved; its mutations may be sent. |
| Throws `PrerequisiteRetry` (the effect answers `error.retry: true`) | Stays pending and runs again after the backoff: 1 s after the first consecutive transient failure, doubling per failure, at most 30 s, with ±20 % jitter - the [runtime prerequisite scheduler](../../../../crates/client/src/runtime/prerequisites.rs)'s policy. The count is in memory; a reopen runs the task at once and starts again. |
| Throws anything else | Failed with the error's text, which `pending_tasks` and `record_status` report as `error`; never retried until the application resets it to `pending`, so a permanent failure does not spin. |

**A failed task keeps its failure while any call waits on it ([#204](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/204)).** A call committed later that requires a task which already failed inherits the failure: its row takes the task's error when it is written, so the call is listed in `client.failures` at once, with that task, instead of waiting silently. The task is not reset: retrying stays the application's explicit act, and one `failures.retry([key])` (or `setReadiness(key, "pending")`) makes it pending for every call waiting on it. Once no call waits on a key - every one was sent, dropped or refused - the key has no rows left, and a later call that requires it starts a fresh pending task. So order decides, inside one transaction too: a repair that drops the only failed call and then submits a replacement requiring the same key starts that task afresh, and the handler runs it once the transaction commits; a replacement submitted before the drop joins the failed task and keeps its failure (ruled 2026-09-28 on [#205](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/205)).

`setReadiness` of a task forgets its backoff, so a reset to `pending` runs it at once. Close cancels the handler's effect: TypeScript aborts the handler's `AbortSignal`, Dart completes its `cancelled` future, and a later settlement is dropped. Nothing waits on a handler, so no call hangs behind a slow upload and nothing is reported after close. An explicit Store reset cancels the run, forgets backoff and scans the reset Store.

Code: compiler checks in [compiler/validate.rs](../../../../crates/compiler/src/validate.rs); key derivation in [client/policies.rs](../../../../crates/client/src/policies.rs); rows in [client/queue.rs](../../../../crates/client/src/queue.rs); outcomes in [client/lib.rs](../../../../crates/client/src/lib.rs) `outcome`; the scheduler in [client/runtime/prerequisites.rs](../../../../crates/client/src/runtime/prerequisites.rs); registration at open in [bindings/common/src/actor.rs](../../../../bindings/common/src/actor.rs); the handler effects in [client-js/connection.mts](../../../../packages/frontend/client-js/bindings/connection.mts) (`prerequisites`, `PrerequisiteRetry`) and [dart/connection.dart](../../../../packages/frontend/dart/lib/src/bindings/connection.dart) (`prerequisiteHandler`, `PrerequisiteRetry`).

## 9. Architecture Decisions

**Handlers at open, no manual runner ([#185](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/185)).** `runPrerequisites(handlers)` made the host decide when tasks ran: every Command that queued a task had to kick the runner, and a transient failure needed the host's own timer and `setReadiness`. The handlers are now fixed at open and the runtime runs them. A manual trigger kept beside it would have meant two sources of handlers and rules for joining a run; the one thing it could add, "retry now", is `setReadiness(key, "pending")`, which also forgets the backoff. `runPrerequisites` was removed.

**A new requirement inherits a failed task; it does not reset it (decided 2026-09-28, [#204](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/204)).** Resetting the task for the new call would retry an upload the application may have given up on, and run it again for every call already waiting on it, behind the author's back. Inheriting keeps one state per task and makes the new call visible in the unsent-work list at once. Cost: a call that would have succeeded on a retry waits for the author to retry.

**The host's timer is the clock of record for a retry.** The runtime waits out a backoff with a `timer` effect; when it fires, every task due by then may run, even if the runtime's own clock is a little behind.

## 10. Quality Requirements

Current [runtime prerequisite tests](../../../../crates/sqlite/tests/runtime_prerequisites.rs), [unsent tests](../../../../crates/sqlite/tests/unsent.rs) and [shared SDK prerequisite harness](../../../../integration/bindings/client-js/prerequisite-harness.mjs) cover dispatch gating, backoff, shared failure inheritance, retry, close and late-effect cancellation. The [shared unsent harness](../../../../integration/bindings/client-js/unsent-harness.mjs) covers drop/replacement order and rollback. Historical v0.4.2 execution does not certify this candidate; consult the joined gate for execution evidence.

## 11. Risks and Technical Debt

**Accepted limitation.** `self` is the only argument expression. The compiler message says "currently"; no issue tracks an extension. Stated for authors in the [schema reference](../../../../website/docs/schema/define.md#relations-prerequisites-and-ordering).

**Accepted limitation.** The Rust API accepts opaque prerequisite keys; a non-JSON key has no `name`, so no handler runs it. Rust callers settle such keys through `set_readiness`.

**Accepted limitation: one handler at a time, backoff in memory.** A slow handler holds back the other tasks of its client until it settles; a transient failure's attempt count does not survive a reopen, so a task that keeps failing transiently runs once at each open before backing off again. No issue tracks parallel handlers or a durable count.
