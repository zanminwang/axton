//! Unsent work observers and resolutions made in a transaction
//! ([#186](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/186),
//! [#205](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/205)).
//!
//! **Observers.** `unsentWatch {view}` reads the retained refusals, the acts
//! blocked on a failed task or the pending count on the committed reader,
//! answers its observer id and publishes the result. Like a watch, it re-runs
//! after every commit - never on a timer, never while a callback transaction
//! is open - and publishes only a result that differs from the last one it
//! published; a re-run that fails is reported and the observer stays. Close
//! ends it with a terminal snapshot carrying its last result; `unwatch` ends
//! it with none.
//!
//! **Resolutions in a transaction.** `dismiss`, `retryTasks` and `discard`
//! run inside the open application transaction, so later reads and
//! submissions of the same callback see their effect, and they commit or roll
//! back with it. What they announce is deferred to the commit: a discarded
//! Call's completion (and its refused dependents') and the reset of a retried
//! task's backoff, which lets the handler registered at open run it. A
//! savepoint rollback forgets the ones made in its scope; a rollback, a failed
//! commit or close forgets them all.
