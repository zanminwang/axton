/// The Dart SDK Bridge over the Rust-owned client runtime
/// ([#134](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/134)).
///
/// A [Bridge] submits complete tasks through the C ABI
/// (`axton_runtime_open/submit/drain/detach`), answers the effects the
/// runtime asks for, delivers each `taskCompleted` to the waiter that
/// submitted it and each `observerChanged` snapshot to the observer claimed
/// at its task's completion. It holds maps and platform resources only: task
/// progression, observer projection, database scheduling and retry stay in
/// Rust, whose actor thread owns SQLite, so admission and drain never block on
/// the database and everything runs on the calling isolate.
///
/// The actor wakes the bridge through one process-wide
/// `NativeCallable.listener`: Rust calls it from its own thread under the
/// actor's sink lock, the trampoline only posts to this isolate, and the drain
/// runs on this isolate's event loop. The VM deletes that callable when the
/// isolate shuts down, so every bridge of the C ABI carries a native finalizer
/// that detaches its runtime then: no wake reaches a deleted callable, and the
/// runtime closes and releases its database. See the
/// [bridge contract](../../../../../../crates/protocols/src/client_bridge/mod.rs).
