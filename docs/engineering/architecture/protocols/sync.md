# Sync protocol

## 1. Introduction and Goals

Protocol 5 separates durable Mutation execution from authoritative delivery. Rust owns admission, retry, replay, coverage, settlement and scheduling. SDKs carry generated interfaces and execute native HTTP, WebSocket, timer and application callback effects; they do not implement another sync policy.

## 3. Context and Scope

One physical SQLite file has one Client, Store identity and Stream. Different files may follow the same Stream. Admission carriers carry `protocol: 5`, `storeId` and `stream`; contextual read, Mutation and delivery requests also carry `materialization`. The server binds the Store to its authenticated principal and Stream. A materialization identifies canonical Model read descriptors and projection generation; a retained schema artifact separately preserves queued Mutation inputs. Credentials and URLs are connection settings, not file identity.

Protocol 5 requires a fresh PostgreSQL framework namespace and fresh format-5 client file. The installer refuses legacy server layouts without modifying existing data. Admission rejects another format before changing the original database, WAL or SHM. It supplies no in-place migration or automatic wipe. See [adoption](../../protocol5-adoption.md) before retiring a protocol-4 backend.

## 5. Building Block View

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [Core carriers](../../../../crates/protocols/src/sync.rs) | Context, immutable Batch, null-cursor reads, delivery headers, manifests, parts and validation. |
| [Client Store](../../../../crates/client/src/store05.rs) | Durable file context, operation input, frozen request, acknowledgment, S/B/C and authority evidence. |
| [Client sync](../../../../crates/client/src/sync05/mod.rs) | Uplink, finite downlink, bounded queue and complete-unit apply. |
| [Client settlement](../../../../crates/client/src/settlement05.rs) | Queue-owned outcomes and accepted work's authority obligations. |
| [Server Batch](../../../../crates/server/src/mutation_batch.rs) | Store admission, per-member transactions, replay and durable results. |
| [Server delivery](../../../../crates/server/src/delivery_plan.rs) | Serializable finite plans, preparation closure, immutable continuation and owned materialization. |
| [PostgreSQL schema](../../../../packages/backend/postgres/migration.sql) | Eight fresh tables: Stream, Record, PublicationFence, Store, MutationResult, StreamRecord, DeliveryPlan and DeliveryUnit. Per-transaction cursor reservation is ephemeral SQL state, not a ninth durable table. |

## 6. Runtime View

### Execution and settlement

Canonical wire and known-descriptor slot validation remain whole-Batch admission checks. An unretained Mutation name/version is instead saved as that member's `mutation_version_unsupported` refusal after Store and Batch admission, without a Handler or preparation call. Independent supported members continue, and exact replay returns the saved result. [The deterministic scenario](../../../../crates/sim/tests/mutation_versions05.rs) joins the server's member engine and persistence seam to a real SQLite client, including settlement, reopen and the next Batch; the [host gate](../../../../integration/v05-sdk/README.md) covers actual HTTP and PostgreSQL.

The client freezes a Batch's sequence, membership and exact input before sending. Each named Mutation executes in its own Serializable server transaction. A business refusal rolls back that member's savepoint and saves rejection/progress; infrastructure failure aborts the transaction. Retrying saved members runs no Handler or preparation. Store metadata admits the current or last completed Batch; accepting the next Batch prunes the older result set transactionally. The client starts the next Batch only after every member of the acknowledged Batch has settled locally, preserving its saved ownership for delayed or retried settlement Materialize. Unassigned work with unmet prerequisites does not hold this window.

There are two completion boundaries. A committed acknowledgment proves the saved execution outcome and survives later local failure. Local settlement also requires every accepted target's Stream authority or permitted private fallback. Only the transaction that commits reconciliation retires its work and emits terminal completion. Receipt-first and Stream-first ordering therefore converge without treating receipt arrival as coverage.

The Mutation queue is the lifecycle owner. It retains original argument paths and schema artifacts; local companions and derived cascades are distinct from wire input. Direct device writes remain device-only. Reconciliation retains accepted companions at their original operation order and replays later local work.

### Publication and ordinary reads

Backend tracking is explicit: returning a Model, storing a Query snapshot or naming a Mutation target does not enroll it. Serializable snapshots and record/canonical Stream guards keep Loader content and position in one transaction; unrelated publications share no namespace-wide lock. A new tracking pair obtains a real position; repeated live tracking retains it. Invalidation updates existing holders without enrolling new ones. One transaction reserves at most one cursor per affected Stream.

Query and Fetch return invocation snapshots with explicit `cursor: null`. They grant no Stream coverage or canonical absence. Commit-time protection prevents a delayed read from replacing newer Stream content or a genuine Stream tombstone. `store: false` returns the snapshot without installing Models. Membership Remove releases holding protection while retaining content and historical evidence; it is distinct from a Loader's authoritative null.

### Finite Bootstrap and Sync

Handshake durably records initial Stream head **S**. The initial committed prefix **C** starts at S; Bootstrap completion **B** remains absent until its final unit commits. Bootstrap selects `@@bootstrap` Models at a finite frozen head. Sync repairs a finite requested prefix rather than replaying every historical transition. Reconnect and moving heads do not rewrite committed S/B/C or make Bootstrap perpetual freshness.

Preparation closes over bounded required identities before canonical Loader reads and head capture. The server stages an immutable DeliveryPlan and DeliveryUnits. Context, intent, header and part digests bind continuation; each continuation authorizes again. Expiry after five minutes returns `delivery.expired` and cleans staging, without claiming coverage. Limits are 100,000 identities and 256 MiB per plan; overflow refuses without partial committed staging.

Same-cursor, uniqueness and cascade dependencies remain complete atomic units. Fragments are transport pieces, never partial commit permission. The native delivery queue bounds metadata and payload, spilling large components to temporary disk staging. It validates and assembles a complete unit before one SQLite apply transaction. Earlier units may remain committed after a later failure; C never crosses unresolved coverage. An overlapping complete unit may apply unseen keys under per-key current/history guards, but partial fragments are never trimmed into invented coverage.

Owned materialization proves saved settlement or compatible schema obligations. It enrolls nothing and advances no range prefix. A foreign-context live header is a repair hint: the client requests HTTP authority in its own context rather than installing the foreign payload.

## 10. Quality Requirements

[Client storage](../client/storage/protocol5.md) and [server](../server/protocol5.md) own detailed invariants. The joined native acceptance gate is `integration/v05-sdk/run-host.sh`; the paired PostgreSQL-to-SQLite capacity gate is `integration/v05-sdk/run-capacity.sh`. Candidate evidence and release gates must identify the tested commit; this document does not certify a release or mobile installation.

## 11. Risks and Technical Debt

Finite bounds do not imply short writer or transaction occupancy. Large uniqueness components intentionally apply as one unit; measured capacity, retained payload and whole-unit apply duration must be reviewed before adoption. Host-native acceptance does not prove iOS/Android artifact or device behavior. [Adoption](../../protocol5-adoption.md) owns these release limits.

## Protocol definitions

[Sync contracts](../../../../crates/protocols/src/sync.rs) and their [delivery](../../../../crates/protocols/src/sync/delivery.rs) / [mutation](../../../../crates/protocols/src/sync/mutation.rs) helpers encode, validate and calculate pure protocol results. They use shared schema normalization and counters from core. Client/Server engines own persistence, scheduling, authority application and business execution.
