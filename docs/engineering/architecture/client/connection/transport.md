# Transport

## 1. Introduction and Goals

Protocol-5 carriers retain Store/Stream/materialization context and exact request identity across retries. Handshake authenticates the Store; Batch submits durable Mutations; read routes return null-cursor invocation snapshots; delivery routes return complete current-state cursor pages. Transport cancellation fences late effects. Neither HTTP success nor receipt arrival proves a committed authority unit.

## 5. Building Block View

[Implementation](../../../../../crates/protocols/src/sync.rs) owns this component. [Protocol 5](../../protocols/sync.md) owns shared context, delivery and settlement rules.
