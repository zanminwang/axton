//! The bridge contract between an SDK and its Rust-owned client runtime
//! ([#134](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/issues/134)).
//!
//! An SDK submits complete tasks and answers the effects the runtime asks
//! for; the runtime owns every decision in between and reports outcomes as
//! events. JSON stays the cross-language encoding: every [`Input`] and
//! [`Event`] is one tagged object, and every identifier the runtime allocates
//! travels as a string so no language has to represent a 64-bit counter.
//!
//! Identities:
//!
//! | Identity | Allocated by | Purpose |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `requestId` | the SDK, increasing per bridge, never reused | route one submitted task or transaction command to its one terminal outcome |
//! | `effectId` | the runtime, unique for its lifetime | correlate one HTTP/timer/callback effect or the lifetime of one socket |
//! | `transactionId` | the runtime, fresh per callback transaction | admit commands only into the transaction that owns them |
//! | `scope` | the runtime, fresh per nested savepoint | admit commands only into the innermost open savepoint |
//! | `callId` | the existing durable call identity | final Call outcomes; never replaced by a request id |
//! | `observerId` | the runtime, unique for its lifetime | route watch/subscription snapshots ([`Event::ObserverChanged`]) |
//!
//! Admission is not completion: the carrier acknowledges that a message was
//! copied into the runtime's mailbox, and the public Promise/Future resolves
//! only from the matching [`Event::TaskCompleted`]. A duplicate active request
//! id is a protocol error reported through [`Diagnostic::Protocol`]; it never
//! executes a second time and never touches the first route.
//!
//! Commands are typed: a task carries a [`Command`] and a callback's command a
//! [`TransactionCommand`], each one `{kind, …}` object. An envelope that does
//! not decode at all is a [`Diagnostic::Protocol`] report, since nothing in it
//! can be routed. An envelope that decodes but whose command does not - an
//! unknown `kind`, a missing or mistyped field - is still admitted under its
//! request id and completes that request with the decoding error, in its
//! turn, so no SDK waiter is left without an answer.
