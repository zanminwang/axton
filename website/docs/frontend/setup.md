# Set up the client

Generate your Model and named Mutation/Query interfaces first ([schema generation](../schema/define.md)). TypeScript, Dart and React Native use the same Rust engine and SQLite Store.

## Open local storage

Supply a writable database path and one Stream. The generated client supplies the schema; the generic runtime also requires `schema`. A connection is optional. Tokens and URLs are connection settings, not Store identity.

```ts
const client = await GeneratedClient.open({
  path: 'local.sqlite', stream: 'User:alice',
  connection: {
    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:4242', token: 'alice',
    options: { onError: console.error },
  },
});
```

```dart
final client = await GeneratedClient.open(
  path: 'local.sqlite', stream: 'User:alice',
  connection: StoreConnection(
    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:4242', token: () => 'alice',
  ),
);
```

Opening commits local storage before starting network work; connectivity is not required to reopen a Store. Normal reopen retains its Store identity, pending Mutations, frozen Batch and delivery progress. Use a separate file for each Stream binding and one active owner per physical file. Protocol 5 requires a fresh format-5 file; another format is refused without changing the original database, WAL or SHM. Keep the old release available to drain or export unresolved work before retiring its backend. The backend reports its projection generation at every handshake; the client has no setting for it.

## Native libraries

Installed Node packages select their platform addon. Installed Dart packages bundle a native library through their build hook. For a source checkout, run `bash scripts/build.sh` and pass Dart's `libraryPath` pointing to `target/debug/libaxton_dart.dylib` on macOS or `libaxton_dart.so` on Linux. React Native requires the [native module](https://github.com/zanminwang/axton/blob/main/packages/frontend/client-react-native/native-module/README.md) in a native build; Expo Go cannot supply it.

Before any Store opens on Android, initialize its stable application support/files directory once:

```dart
// Obtain this path from the application's platform directory provider.
Client.configureApplicationData(applicationSupportDirectory.path);
```

This is process-wide application configuration. Reusing the same directory is safe; changing it after initialization fails. Do not generate a temporary directory per client or use this setting to bypass physical Store ownership. The explicit `libraryPath` variant supports source-checkout development. A normal macOS/iOS/Linux desktop host can use the engine's stable application-directory default.

## Bootstrap and observe

```ts
await client.bootstrap();
const stop = client.models.entry.watch({}, rows => render(rows));
```

```dart
await client.bootstrap();
final subscription = client.models.entry.watch().listen(render);
```

Bootstrap waits for complete finite authority units at its captured head; it does not promise perpetual freshness. An empty result still completes. Models marked `@@bootstrap` are selected initially and again after a materialization rollover. The Stream supplied at open continues delivering after Bootstrap. Watch local Models for continuous state and use Query/Fetch results as invocation snapshots.

Close the client when its application session ends; cancel individual observers when their view ends. See [the generated API](client-api.md) for named Mutations, request-level storage, local transactions and unsent-work controls.
