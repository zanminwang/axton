# Protocol 5 host gate

Run from the repository root:

```sh
bash integration/sdk/run-host.sh
```

The runner builds this checkout's native libraries, regenerates typed SDKs,
checks TypeScript and Dart, and starts a disposable PostgreSQL cluster. Every
client uses Rust/SQLite and the generated SDK; every server uses the generated
backend with application handlers and viewer Loaders.

`server.mjs` forwards real HTTP and WebSocket bytes. Named faults discard a
completed Mutation response, hold initial handshakes and Mutation acknowledgements,
and delay a completed Query response. SQLite triggers independently abort local
acknowledgement and settlement commits after the real cloud has accepted work. These controls change transport timing, not protocol authority.
`client.mjs` also starts a process that exits immediately after a committed
local transaction, then reopens its Store without the original Call waiter.

The P7 scenario sends supported/unsupported/supported calls through real HTTP and PostgreSQL, checks exact saved-result replay, retains structural HTTP400 for malformed JSON/digests, and reopens the SQLite client before the next Batch. Both an unretained name and an unsupported version become durable member refusals without executing their handler.

PostgreSQL's adapter reports the last original serialization error after its
initial attempt and three retries fail. The P7 oracle requires an exact object
bijection between reported errors and transaction escapes, four attempts and a
typed retryable failure; unmatched and nonretryable defects fail the test.
An independent case injects four raw failures inside the initial handshake's
adapter body, checks HTTP500 and no account framework/domain writes, then proves
SDK recovery through a successful handshake and one named Mutation execution.
Existing adapter/native tests own retry classification and rollback internals.

The tests assert exact Batch retry, refusal isolation, private settlement,
receipt settlement beneath a later pending Mutation, independent Store identities, zero-cursor Bootstrap,
fresh read snapshots, Store modes, physical file aliases,
stale Query protection, initial-start ordering, durable completion lookup, and
Dart's typed completion across the same actual host. The upgraded fixture marks
another Model `@@bootstrap`. Against it, an upgrade commits at open with every
row kept and `S = C`, Bootstraps the new selection over handshake and pull
alone, and receives later changes by Sync from `C`. A Batch frozen before the
upgrade is sent after it with the same digest in the new context. A Batch
executed before it whose receipt was lost replays its old label and settles
without installing its snapshot. A separate versioned fixture retains Model and
Mutation v1 history while serving v2; Bootstrap fills its new nullable field over
the held row at the same record cursor. Generation cases upgrade a fresh file to
a backend's projection generation 2 at its first handshake, and an initialized
Store without any request in the dropped context. A concurrency
case settles 60 Mutations from one Store over push and pull alone with fewer
than 10 serialization retries. Query enrollment is tested both for implicit absence
and deliberate tracking through the authenticated Stream context.

The deterministic `crates/sim/src/scenario.rs` runner complements this gate
with receipt/authority permutations and five SQLite reopen boundaries. Its
cloud acknowledgements are fixtures; it does not substitute for this host.

`AXTON_GATE_TESTS` optionally selects test names for diagnosis; an unset value
runs the complete gate. `AXTON_GATE_TRACE=1` prints fixture requests and response
summaries. Neither control changes protocol behavior or bypasses native builds.
